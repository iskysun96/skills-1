# Box Agent Skills

Agent Skills to help developers using AI agents work with Box. Whether you're building Box integrations in code, working with Box content via MCP tools, configuring webhooks, or using Box AI retrieval — this plugin gives your assistant the context it needs to do it right.

The skills in this repo follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format and can also be installed as a plugin for platforms like Codex, [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Claude](https://claude.com), including Claude Code and Cowork, and [Kiro](https://kiro.dev).

## Installation

### As an Agent Skill

```bash
# Choose skills interactively
npx skills add box/skills

# Or install the Box CLI skill independently
npx skills add box/skills --skill box-cli
```

Check out the latest and full list of skills [here](https://skills.sh/box/skills).

### As a Platform Plugin

This repo can also be installed as a plugin for supported platforms. MCP connection and OAuth setup vary by platform — see the setup guide for your platform below.

The root `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` follow the [Agent Plugins v1.0.0 specification](https://agent-plugins.org/specification). The portable MCP configuration declares the Box MCP endpoint; authentication remains managed by each client. Do not add credentials to this repository's root `mcp.json`; configure them only in your client's settings.

| Platform | Setup guide |
|---|---|
| Codex | [`.codex-plugin/README.md`](.codex-plugin/README.md) |
| Cursor | [`.cursor-plugin/README.md`](.cursor-plugin/README.md) |
| Claude Code | [`.claude-plugin/README.md`](.claude-plugin/README.md) |
| Kiro | [Install as a Kiro Power](#kiro-power) |

### Kiro Power

In Kiro, open the Powers panel and install the Box Power. If it is not shown in the catalog, select **Add Custom Power** → **Import power from GitHub** and enter `https://github.com/box/skills`. The bundled skills work in both Kiro IDE and CLI.

Note that the Box MCP Server currently does not support Dynamic Client Registration, so credential-free Power authentication is not yet available in Kiro IDE. Kiro CLI users can configure Box OAuth client credentials in their user MCP settings; future managed OAuth integration or confidential-client OAuth support in the IDE can enable the bundled MCP connection there.

Try it with: `Use the Box Power to add Box file upload to this app.`

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `box` | General Box foundation and router |
| `box-cli` | Reliable Box CLI operations, automation, bulk work, and recovery |
| `box-legal-workflows` | Shared legal workflow guidance |
| `box-legal-workflows-intake` | Legal intake and onboarding |
| `box-legal-workflows-contract` | Contract review and monitoring |
| `box-legal-workflows-ma` | M&A virtual data rooms |

## Usage

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected. Here are some example prompts:

### Implement Box content workflows

`Add Box file upload to my app`

`Create a shared link for this folder`

`Set up Box webhooks for new file events`

### Build document-driven flows

`Search my Box account for invoices`

`Use Box AI to classify documents`

`Wire webhooks to process new uploads`

### Troubleshoot integrations

`Debug 401 errors with my Box JWT auth`

`Fix webhook signature verification`

## Skill Structure

The skills follow the [Agent Skills Open Standard](https://agentskills.io/). Each skill owns its instructions and can be installed independently.

- `SKILL.md` - Required manifest and task guidance
- `references/` - Optional skill-local detail for substantial conditional workflows
- `scripts/` or `assets/` - Optional executable helpers or output templates

`box-cli` intentionally starts as a single `SKILL.md`. It uses installed CLI help and current public Box documentation for changing command details rather than vendoring a command catalog.

## Prerequisites

- **Box CLI** (optional) — Install from [developer.box.com/guides/cli](https://developer.box.com/guides/cli) for CLI-first verification.
- **BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN** (optional) — For direct REST verification when Box CLI is unavailable.

## Quick Verification

Preferred order for agent tooling is MCP first, Box CLI second, and direct REST only as a last-resort fallback.

```bash
# With Box CLI installed and authenticated:
box users:get me --json
box folders:items 0 --json --max-items 5

# Last-resort fallback (for sessions where MCP/CLI are unavailable):
export BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/0"
```

## Contributing

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions, plus only the supporting resources its workflow requires.
