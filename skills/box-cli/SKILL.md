# Box CLI

Use the installed Box CLI to complete and verify Box operations. This skill is self-contained and can be installed without the general `box` skill.

## Operating workflow

1. Identify the requested outcome, target, and actor. If the request leaves a risky target, recipient, role, impersonated user, or batch scope ambiguous, ask one focused question before running a command.
2. Establish the active Box identity once per task:

   ```bash
   box users:get me --json --fields id,name,login
   ```

   Reuse the same environment and `--as-user` value throughout the operation and its verification. Never switch to a more privileged identity merely to bypass an error.
3. Resolve human-readable names to stable Box IDs before mutation. If multiple items match, present the candidates and ask the user to choose.
4. Prefer a dedicated CLI command. Add `--json` for machine-readable output and narrow `--fields` to the data needed for the task.
5. Treat a mutation response as provisional. Read the returned item or affected collection with the same actor and verify the requested state.
6. Report the actor, action, relevant object IDs, verification evidence, and any unresolved failure. Include commands when they help the user reproduce the result.

## Common patterns

Use these known forms directly when they fit. Do not probe with `--help` first unless the installed command rejects the syntax.

```bash
# Identify the actor
box users:get me --json --fields id,name,login

# Inspect the root folder and a bounded set of children
box folders:get 0 --json --fields id,name
box folders:items 0 --json --fields id,type,name --max-items 20

# Search and preserve parent information for disambiguation
box search "Launch Plan" --json --fields id,type,name,parent --limit 20

# Read an item by ID
box files:get <FILE_ID> --json --fields id,name,parent,owned_by
box folders:get <FOLDER_ID> --json --fields id,name,parent,owned_by

# Create, then verify the returned folder ID
box folders:create <PARENT_FOLDER_ID> "Approved Assets" --json
box folders:get <RETURNED_FOLDER_ID> --json --fields id,name,parent
```

Box uses `0` as the root folder ID. A path or item name is not a stable identifier.

For an unfamiliar or rejected command, inspect only that command:

```bash
box <topic>:<command> --help
```

Use the installed help as the authority for flags and argument order. CLI interfaces can change after this skill is published.

## Setup and authentication

Only enter setup mode when the CLI is absent, authentication fails, or the user asks for it.

```bash
npm install --global @box/cli
box login -d
```

- `box login -d` uses the official Box CLI application for interactive content operations.
- In a headless environment, use `box login --code` and have the user complete authorization themselves.
- Use `box login --platform-app` when the user needs a custom OAuth application or scopes beyond the official CLI application.
- For approved server automation with JWT or Client Credentials Grant, use the current `box configure:environments:add --help` flow and protect the configuration file outside source control.
- Developer tokens are for short local tests. Do not embed tokens, client secrets, private keys, or authorization codes in commands, prompts, logs, fixtures, or repository files.

After setup, verify the identity with `box users:get me`; do not print credential stores or raw environment configuration.

## Risky and destructive work

The request must explicitly authorize the exact scope before:

- deleting or permanently deleting content;
- creating, changing, or removing collaborations or shared links;
- impersonating another user;
- changing enterprise users, groups, retention, or governance settings; or
- running a broad batch that can alter many objects.

If that authorization is absent, show the actor, target IDs, proposed role or change, and batch size, then ask for confirmation. Do not rely on CLI prompts because some destructive commands do not prompt.

Prefer narrow operations. Run dependent writes serially. Preserve any returned ID and use it for verification rather than repeating a name-based search.

## Bulk operations and recovery

Box CLI commands accept CSV or JSON input through `--bulk-file-path`. Before executing a batch:

1. Inspect the specific command's help so input columns match its arguments and flags.
2. Validate a small representative subset when the operation is reversible and the user has authorized it.
3. Record a stable source-row key, intended target ID, and outcome for reconciliation.
4. Avoid parallel dependent mutations and uncontrolled retry loops.

For partial failures:

- Treat successful rows as committed until verification proves otherwise.
- Retry `429` responses only after the indicated delay.
- Retry timeouts or `5xx` responses only when the operation is idempotent or a read proves the mutation did not occur.
- Do not retry `401`, `403`, or ambiguous writes unchanged. Correct identity, permission, or state first.
- Retry only the verified-safe failed subset, then reconcile every source row against Box.

Never restart an entire partially successful mutation batch merely because some rows failed.

## REST fallback

When no dedicated command exists, prefer `box request` because it reuses the selected CLI identity:

```bash
box request /folders/0/items --query "limit=5" --json
```

Inspect `box request --help` before a write. Use explicit method, body, and query values, then verify the resulting Box object through a read. Raw `curl` with a bearer token is outside the normal workflow and should be used only when the user supplies an approved secure authentication mechanism.

## Definition of done

A Box CLI task is complete when:

- the command ran under the intended actor;
- the target was identified by Box ID;
- every mutation was verified from server state;
- partial failures and retries are accounted for; and
- the response states what changed and what remains unresolved.
